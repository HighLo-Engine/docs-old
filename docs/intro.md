# Intro

## What is the HighLo-Engine and what makes it special?

The HighLo-Engine is a free Open Source GameEngine, that can either be used for real time games (as well as multiplayer games) or for movies by rendering the scene into a mp4 file or frame by frame into a directory.

We actively work on the engine, so you can see the current implemented features and the planned features in our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/HXJ2X0sb/highloengine)

## Getting started

To get started visit the [Download](https://www.highlo-engine.com/en/download) page of the engine and start downloading the LevelEditor, named **HighLoEdit**.

The Website should automatically detect your operating system and recommend the right download for you but if that fails you can also download the right version [manually](https://www.highlo-engine.com/en/downloads).
